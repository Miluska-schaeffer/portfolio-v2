        Daily routines and schedules have become extremely hectic and hence, the popularity of all kind of tracking apps has increased significantly, specially the ones related to fitness, wellness & health.

        <p>Analyze an already existing app and incorporate a new feature into it. The feature to be developed will be based on an area of functionality to be explored and compared to user input.
          The work will culminate in a high-fidelity prototype of a native app that reflects the best path forward based on research, iteration, and testing.</p>

      <p>As for this point, we only had the very basic idea of building a stress tracking application, so we started by doing user research and discover what are the opinions of the users on this kind of apps in general, who would be interested in using such an app and what they would expect to find in it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">

        <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">USER RESEARCH</h2>
        <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">Survey</h2>
        <img class="case_image" src="" alt="##">
    </div>
    <div>

        <div>
          <p>We conducted a survey which led us to the following points :</p>
          <ul class="text_list">
            <li>Most of the users had already had experiences with tracking apps for their phones, including those related to health. </li>
            <li>They have a positive opinion of this kind of application in general, they believe they are a useful tool.</li>
            <li> They were very aware of their stress levels and consider it important to find ways to reduce them.</li>
            <li>When thinking about stress, the main factors they recognize to influence it directly are not having time to relax, not sleeping enough, and eating badly.</li>
            <li>When asked about ways to track their stress many users mentioned activities like journaling, taking short pauses, breathing exercises, and meditation.</li>
            <li>When asked specifically about their previous experience with stress tracking apps most of them said not having used one yet but seemed open to trying one that is simple & direct.</li>
            <li>They mentioned it would be very important for the app to have useful information on how to reduce stress.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">Interviews</h2>
        <div>
          <p>To have a more profound view of our user's opinions and confirm the information coming from the survey, we continued our research by conducting interviews, from which we gathered the following points :</p>
          <ul class="text_list">
            <li>Aware of how stress affects them, find it very important to keep an eye on it and reduce it.</li>
            <li>They mention recognizing their mood and its changes as directly connected to their stress levels.</li>
            <li>They recognize bad eating, sleeping & not taking time to relax as factors that affect their stress & mood.</li>
            <li>They mentioned some applications are too “persistent” and send too many notifications or expect them to use them all the time.</li>
            <li>Had no experience with a stress tracking app but are very open to trying one that is simple, direct, easy-to-use & won’t get complex with time. </li>
            <li>Would like it to be personalized & give them positive reminders based on their previous information, that could help them not only to reach a goal (which could cause them anxiety) but long term and gives them the feeling of being talking to a friend or writing a journal.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

     <div class="subsection">
      <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">HOW MIGHT WE?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Choosing a final HMW question helped us to see the problem from a specific angle and focus our work to arrive at a possible way to solve it more efficiently.
           The next one was our final HMW :</p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
      <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">Persona</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Having narrowed down the problem, we worked on interpreting the data coming from the user in order to create a user persona.</p>
      </div>
      <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
      <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">LO-FI</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Knowing the features we would implement for this MVP, we starting sketching what would be a Lo-fi prototype from the whole application, including a welcoming for new users. This helped us to have a first base of the app’s structure, which then we used to build our user flow on the next step.</p>
      </div>
      <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">
      <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
      <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">MID-FI</h2>
      <div>
        <p>After testing the first Lo-fi and having positive first feedback we jumped into working on a mid-fi prototype.</p>
      </div>
      <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">
      <div>
        <p>After testing this mid-fi prototype, we received the following feedback :</p>
        <ul class="text_list">
            <li>At this point, it was only possible to access the weekly highlights screen from the “today” menu, by clicking directly on the month graphic, which made it confusing how to access both, monthly results & weekly highlights.</li>
            <li>Showing the monthly results as the first step before the weekly highlights was also confusing. In the minds of our testers, it made more sense to deal with the weekly action first and then pass to the monthly one.</li>
            <li>The visual elements indicating the weekly highlights of each week seemed too small and not so attractive for the testers.</li>
            <li>About the 10 questions survey: It is important to mention that the length of the survey was a concern that we had since the beginning but after testing it, the users were more than happy to answer it and even commented that they felt the length gave them the feeling the test was trustworthy. The fact that it is only to be answered once a month, was also a plus.</li>
          </ul>
          <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
      <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">Iterating</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Considering all the feedback we received on the last iteration, we made some changes and built this second mid-fi prototype, which mainly includes :</p>
      </div>
      <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">
      <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
      <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">User flow</h2>
      <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">
    </div>


    <div class="subsection">
      <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">VISUAL IDENTITY</h2>
      <H2 class="case_section_subtitle">Moodboard & Style Tile</H2>
      <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">
      <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">
      <p>Considering all these points, we came up with the name “Ease” for our brand and a very smooth & simple logo that would reflect the essence of the whole app.</p>
      <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">HI-FI PROTOTYPE</h2>
        <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">

        <div>
          <p>Before this final version, we tested a previous one, receiving  the following feedback:</p>
          <ul class="text_list">
            <li>The text on the phone notification was misleading, we changed it from “how is your week going” to “how has your week been going”.</li>
            <li>The info box on the “Highlights” screen was not visible enough. As it was very important for the user to read that piece of info, we changed the color to make it more visible but still, maintain the whole tone.</li>
            <li>The same issue was present on the results page, where the cards including reading recommendations were not visible enough.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">

      <p>It was a great experience working completely from zero and see our product take shape according to our findings.</p>
     </div>

     <div class="subsection">
        <h2 class="case_section_subtitle">NEXT STEPS</h2>
        <img class="case_image" src="" alt="">

        <div>
          <ul class="text_list">
            <li>Run more usability tests to make sure the tasks in our high fidelity prototype are clear.</li>
            <li>Especially gathering more opinions on the length of the XXX stress survey.</li>
            <li>Doing a visual assesment of the whole app, considering the look and feel & name & logo.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
